abstract: This system is programmed to offer holistic care to paralysis patients through the integration of symptom monitoring, medical treatment support, and rehabilitation support utilizing IoT technology. The proposed system consists of networked devices like sensors, wearables, and a web application that communicate with each other and healthcare providers. The flex sensors monitor patient movements, the AD8232 ECG sensor monitors cardiac activity, the MPU6050 monitors falls, and a temperature sensor offers body temperature monitoring. Information is transmitted wirelessly via an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module to a Node-RED dashboard, enabling real-time visualization and instant notifications. The system offers rehabilitation exercises, medication and activity reminders, and health data collection for analytics. Smart algorithms allow healthcare providers to detect behavioral patterns, enabling customized interventions and treatment plans. This IoT-based system offers customized, realtime healthcare, enhancing treatment outcomes and quality of life for paralysis patients.
