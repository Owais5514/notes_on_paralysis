abstract: The loT patient health monitoring system powered by solar panels is an innovative idea that uses the Internet of Things (loT) and renewable energy to electronically monitor patient health. The system is comprised of various sensors that are coupled to an ESP8266 microcontroller, which sends the collected data to a central server (Thing Speak) via a Wi- Fi module. The computer processes and analyses the data, and healthcare practitioners can access the patient's health information via an outline dashboard or mobile app, The usage of solar panels as a power source is unique to this project. The system is ecologically benign and self-sufficient because it is not connected to the mains. The system's solar panels make it ideal for deployment in rural areas where power is in short supply. It will help people become more aware of their health situation and take proper action
