abstract: The integration of emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and blockchain is transforming the landscape of modern healthcare. These technologies enable real-time monitoring, data-driven diagnostics, personalized treatment, and remote patient care, leading to more efficient and accessible healthcare delivery. This article presents a comprehensive review of smart and advanced healthcare solutions driven by these technologies, exploring their architecture, applications, benefits, and limitations. It categorizes healthcare use cases into critical domains, including wearable health devices, intelligent diagnostics, telemedicine, and emergency response systems. Furthermore, this article critically examines key challenges such as interoperability, energy efficiency, data quality, security, and ethical concerns. To address these issues, it discusses current solutions and highlights future research directions essential for scalable and sustainable healthcare innovation
