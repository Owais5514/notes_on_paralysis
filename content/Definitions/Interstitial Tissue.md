Interstitial tissue is a fundamental, yet often overlooked, component of the body, defined as the **supportive tissue found in the spaces between cells and organs**. It is a key part of the larger "interstitium," a recently recognized network of fluid-filled spaces that is continuous throughout the body. This intricate web is not merely a passive filler but an active and dynamic system crucial for numerous physiological functions.

> Think of it as the body's internal scaffolding or packing material.

Based on my note on [[Sclerosis]], an increase in interstitial tissue is a cause of the pathological hardening of tissue.

Here are its key characteristics:

*   **What it is:** It's a network of both fluid and tissue. This network is primarily made up of collagen and elastin fibers, which provide structural support and flexibility.
*   **Where it is:** It's found everywhere in the body, surrounding and supporting organs, muscles, blood vessels, and nerves.
*   **What it does:**
    *   **Provides Structural Support:** It holds organs and tissues in place.
    *   **Transports Substances:** The fluid within this tissue (interstitial fluid) helps transport nutrients from the blood to the cells and carries waste products away from the cells.
    *   **Facilitates Communication:** It allows for the movement of signaling molecules between cells.

In the context of your [[Sclerosis]] note, when there is chronic inflammation or disease, the body might produce an excess of collagen fibers within the interstitial tissue. This overgrowth leads to the hardening and loss of elasticity characteristic of sclerosis.
